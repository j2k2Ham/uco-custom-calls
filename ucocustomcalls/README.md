# UCO Custom Calls

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Project Additions

This project has been extended beyond the default template with tooling and utilities focused on commerce-like cart functionality, testing, and code quality.

### Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- |
| `npm run dev` | Start development server (Next.js + Turbopack) |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm start` | Run production build |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint (Flat config + Next.js rules) |
| `npm run lint:css` | Run Stylelint over global and module CSS |
| `npm test` | Run Vitest once |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run Vitest in watch mode |

### Testing

The test stack uses Vitest + React Testing Library (`jsdom` environment). Current coverage focuses on the cart hook logic (`src/hooks/useCart.ts`).

Scenarios covered:

1. Add first item (count & total increment)
2. Add duplicate item (quantity accumulation)
3. Remove single item
4. Clear all items

Local storage is cleared (`beforeEach`) to ensure deterministic tests. If you add new persistence features, mirror that reset pattern.

### Cart Hook API (`useCart`)

Located at `src/hooks/useCart.ts`. Provides a context-backed shopping cart with SSRâ€‘safe hydration.

State shape:

```ts
type CartItem = Product & { quantity: number };
interface CartState {
  items: CartItem[];
  count: number;   // total item quantity
  total: number;   // total price in cents
}
```

Exports:

```ts
function useCart(): CartState & {
  add(product: Product): void;
  remove(id: string): void;      // removes entire line
  clear(): void;                 // empties cart
};
```

Persistence: Serializes to `localStorage` under the key `cart`. Guarded so it is safe during SSR / static builds (access only in `useEffect`).

### Currency Utilities

`src/lib/currency.ts` centralizes formatting and arithmetic:

```ts
formatUSD(cents: number): string; // Intl.NumberFormat, USD
sumCents(values: number[]): number; // reduce helper
```
`Price` component (`src/components/Price.tsx`) uses `formatUSD` to keep pricing consistent.

### Tailwind CSS v4 Notes

Tailwind v4 removes the standalone CLI in favor of the PostCSS plugin. This project configures Tailwind via `postcss.config.mjs`:

```js
import tailwind from '@tailwindcss/postcss';
export default { plugins: [tailwind()] };
```
Global styles (`src/app/globals.css`) include `@import "tailwindcss";` and an inline theme block (`@theme inline { ... }`) that defines semantic tokens (e.g. `--color-bg`).

### Linting

- ESLint (Flat config) covers TypeScript/React/Next core vitals.
- Stylelint validates CSS (standard config) and plays well with Tailwind utility layers.
- Run both with: `npm run lint && npm run lint:css`.

### SonarQube / Code Quality

`sonar-project.properties` is scoped so only `src/` under this package is analyzed. Adjust `sonar.sources` or exclusions as needed. Add coverage reporting later by integrating `vitest --coverage` and pointing Sonar to the LCOV file.

### Test Coverage

Coverage is generated with V8 instrumentation via Vitest.

Commands:

```bash
npm run test:coverage   # produces text + html + lcov
```

Output:

- HTML report: `coverage/html/index.html`
- LCOV file: `coverage/lcov.info`

Sonar integration:
`sonar.javascript.lcov.reportPaths=ucocustomcalls/coverage/lcov.info` (already added).

Threshold Strategy:

- Initial low thresholds allowed incremental onboarding of tests.
- Current enforced minimums (see `vitest.config.ts`): Lines 70%, Statements 70%, Functions 60%, Branches 60%.
- Recent suite run (date approximate) achieved ~82% lines/statements overall; headroom retained for adding new, still-untested components (`Hero`, `ProductCard`, etc.).
- Raise again once new components receive coverage and sustained baseline stays >10% above thresholds.

### Continuous Integration (CI)

GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on pushes and PRs against `main`:

Steps:

1. Install dependencies (`npm ci` in `ucocustomcalls`)
2. ESLint + Stylelint
3. Tests + Coverage (`npm run test:ci` uses `--passWithNoTests` for config-only PRs)
4. Coverage artifacts uploaded (HTML + lcov)
5. Separate Sonar job re-runs coverage to ensure `lcov.info` then executes scan (requires `SONAR_TOKEN` secret)

Secrets Required:

- `SONAR_TOKEN`: SonarCloud project token

Scripts:

```bash
npm run test:ci       # CI-friendly run with coverage + passWithNoTests
npm run test:coverage # Local full coverage
```

Adjusting Thresholds:

- Update `thresholds` in `vitest.config.ts` as more components/pages gain tests.
- Keep incremental (e.g., +10% lines per milestone) to avoid blocking PRs.

### Accessibility Enhancements

Audio components include `<track>` elements for captions. A placeholder WebVTT file lives at `public/captions/blank.vtt` and can be replaced with real transcripts.

### Future Enhancements (Ideas)

- Quantity decrement vs full remove
- Line item price caching (derived vs stored)
- Coupon/discount abstraction
- Currency & locale switching (extend formatter)
- Test coverage for persistence rehydration

### Contributing

1. Install deps: `npm install`
2. Run lint & tests before pushing: `npm run lint && npm run lint:css && npm test`
3. Keep new utilities framework-agnostic and typed.
